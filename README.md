Facility Rental Reservation System (FRRS) is a web project for an online conference room reservation system

### Current Implementation

Facility Rental Reservation System (FRRS) provides access to all the features of the website for authenticated and authorized users. 
After login in into the system, authorized and authenticated user is redirected to a webpage that would allow him/her to interact with the system. 
User can then choose to:
1.  login/logout of the system
2.  search for all available rooms by date and maximum number occupancy
3.  make a reservation for a specific date and room
4.  view his/her previous reservations
5.  make a payment by check, cash or credit card.

Facility Rental Reservation Online System (FRRS) consists of two parts:
1.	Reservation web site that enables clients to view, reserve and cancel room reservations.
2.	Database with client information such as user name, address, login and password, reservations history and facility's information regarding rooms availability, price etc.

Payment option is just a mock up.

HTML needs to be redesigned to a responsive website.

Create standalone Adroid and iPhone app.
